 * Event fired when the {@link NetworkRegistry} is being set up.

 * <p>
 * There are a few base rules for custom payloads:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Payloads should not write their ids within their {@link StreamCodec}, as this will be done automatically.</li>
 * <li>Payloads must be registered before they can be sent over the network.</li>
 * <li>Payloads may only be sent over the {@link ConnectionProtocol} they were registered for.</li>
 * <li>By default, {@link PayloadRegistrar} will wrap handlers so they execute on the main thread instead of the network thread.</li>
 * <li>Payloads are always serialized, including for {@link Connection#isMemoryConnection() memory connections} (singleplayer and LAN hosts).</li>
 * <ul>
